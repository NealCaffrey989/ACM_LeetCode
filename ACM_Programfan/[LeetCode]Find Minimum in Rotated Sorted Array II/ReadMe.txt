AppWizard has created this [LeetCode]Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your [LeetCode]Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II application.


[LeetCode]Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project
